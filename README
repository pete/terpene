A client library for interacting with the Nacreon PaaS (see
https://github.com/pete/nacreon).  It includes a command-line interface
(currently limited) and a client.  It is (hopefully) written in such a way that
it should function well as a reference implementation for clients in other
languages, although the Nacreon API is not guaranteed to be stable.

Terpene will be updated when Nacreon is; we're using it to develop.
